  <h1 align="center">Fleiya Dashboard</h1>

  **Fleiya Dashboard** is the web-facing user interface for Fleiya &mdash; an injectable Windows .dll that enhances the user's playing experience with quality-of-life updates &mdash; which provides the end-user with a variety of information &mdash; Pok&eacute;dex information, item information, guides for in-game content, and more &mdash; in a single place.

  This is meant to be an extension to &mdash; or even replacement of &mdash; [Pok&eacute;One Community](https://pokeonecommunity.com/) once it is finished, as the Pok&eacute;One Community website is often quite slow and lacks a fair bit of useful information.
